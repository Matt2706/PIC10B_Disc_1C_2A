Virtual Function in C++
A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class. When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived class’s version of the function.

Pure Virtual Functions in C++
A pure virtual function (or abstract function) in C++ is a virtual function for which we don’t have an implementation, we only declare it. A pure virtual function is declared by assigning 0 in the declaration.

Similarities between virtual function and pure virtual function

These are the concepts of Run-time polymorphism.
Prototype i.e. Declaration of both the functions remains the same throughout the program.
These functions can’t be global or static.
