Difference between C style class and C++ style cast: [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1609163/what-is-the-difference-between-static-cast-and-c-style-casting)
Some Points:   
C++ style casts are checked by the compiler. C style casts aren't and can fail at runtime.  
C++ style casts can be searched for easily, whereas it's really hard to search for c style casts.   
Another big benefit is that the 4 different C++ style casts express the intent of the programmer more clearly.
