 
Each C++ expression (an operator with its operands, a literal, a variable name, etc.) is characterized by two independent properties: a type and a value category. Each expression has some non-reference type, and each expression belongs to exactly one of the three primary value categories: pr value, x value, and l value.


In C++03, an expression is either an r value or an l value.                                

In C++11, an expression can be an:                                       

r value                
l value               
xv alue              
gl value                
pr value
