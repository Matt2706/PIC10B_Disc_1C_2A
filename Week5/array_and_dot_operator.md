### Arrow Operator -> in C++ 
An Arrow operator in C/C++ allows to access elements in Structures and Unions. It is used with a pointer variable pointing to a structure or union. The arrow operator is formed by using a minus sign, followed by the greater than symbol as shown below.             
**Syntax:**
```
(pointer_name)->(variable_name)
```
**Operation:** The -> operator in C or C++ gives the value held by variable_name to structure or union variable pointer_name.         
#### Difference between Dot(.) and Arrow(->) operator:
- The Dot(.) operator is used to normally access members of a structure or union.
- The Arrow(->) operator exists to access the members of the structure or the unions using pointers.
