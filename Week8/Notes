# std::array
It is a class that is part of the STL library , STL means( Standard Template Library). This is a class that the STL gives you to manage static arrays( class that have a fixed size and do not grow).
Syntax:
```
std::array<int,5> data;
data[0]=1;
data[1]=2;
data[2]=3;
```
It is really similar to the previous type of array declarations students are familiar with: 
```
int data[5];
data[0]=1;
data[1]=2;
data[2]=3;
```
we have access to a lot of STL functionality, we can use .begin(), .size(), the main difference is that std::array will give you access to a lot of the STL functionality because it supports iterators. You can also use .sort(). It is also stored on the stack, so it is also fast. A small drawback would be for some reason if you are restricted in a question to not add any header files then you might not be able to use it since it needs 
```
#include<array> // is needed to run std::array
```
Are vectors allocated on the stack or the heap? [Link1](
