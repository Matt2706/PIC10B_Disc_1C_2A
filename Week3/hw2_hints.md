### Friend keyword 
 
Friend Class A friend class can access private and protected members of other class in which it is declared as friend. It is sometimes useful to allow a particular 
class to access private members of other class.

Friend Function Like friend class, a friend function can be given a special grant to access private and protected members. A friend function can be: 
a) A member of another class 
b) A global function 
 Following are some important points about friend functions and classes: 
1) Friends should be used only for limited purpose. too many functions or external classes are declared as friends of a class with protected or private data, it lessens the value of encapsulation of separate classes in object-oriented programming.
2) Friendship is not mutual. If class A is a friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become a friend of A automatically.
3) Friendhsip is different Not Inherited. (Expansion Needed) [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/friend-class-function-cpp/) [link2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-and-friendship-in-cpp/) [link3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-c/)
